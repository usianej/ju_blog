This is a good first start for any one looking to get into DevOps, it has a practical approach to DevOps,
Using azure DevOps as the lab. 

You really don't need to know anything about DevOps to start with this book all you need is just the desire to learn, having a basic understanding of git could be helpful when making use of this book. It doesn't make you a DevOps engineer, but it is a great place to start. You could study this book in a week, It is quite small but if you would follow through the steps it should take you a week or two to go through the book, if you are not going to follow the practical guide you could read the book in a day.

I would also recommend John Savill's DevOps course on YouTube before you apply take on this book. John Savill's course gives you a high level introduction to DevOps and he does offer a very powerful lecture on git witch is by far the best course on git that i have seen.

An approach that worked for me was to break my study time into small chunks of 2hrs and when I came across an obstacle I sometimes step away from my computer and just do a kind of passive troubleshooting where I am not actively on the problem. 

It's a great book and I will recommend it.
